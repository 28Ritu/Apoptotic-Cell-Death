# Apoptotic-Cell-Death

## Course: Introduction To Quantitaive Biology (IQB)

### Objective:
    1. To generate groups of MC runs using bootstrapping based on given data.
    2. To decide between cell survival and death depending upon the Caspase 3 activation threshold.
    3. To estimate the number of cell death in each group and generate a histogram from such estimates.
